## Overview
Checkout project DEMO [here.](http://vue-path-repo.site/kanban/dist/)  
The [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/) course inspired me to create such application.
I have never used the drag & drop technique in vue-applications before, and I'm glad I've managed to do this, even with encapsulated logic in the separate component. 
Also, that was my first shot with animating vue components.
